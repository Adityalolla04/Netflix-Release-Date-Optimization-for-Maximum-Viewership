# Netflix Release Date Optimization

## Description

The Netflix Release Date Optimization project focuses on analyzing the release patterns of Netflix titles to optimize the release timing for maximizing viewership. By leveraging a dataset of Netflix titles (`netflix_titles.csv`), this project provides insights into trends such as seasonal content distribution, top genres, and directors. Additionally, it predicts the optimal season for releasing a title based on historical data using a Random Forest classifier.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Dataset Overview**: The dataset contains 8,807 entries with features like title, type (movie or TV show), director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, and description.
- **Data Issues Addressed**:
  - Missing values in columns like `country`, `director`, and `cast` were replaced with `"Unknown"`.
  - A new feature, `season`, was created by mapping release months to their corresponding seasons (e.g., `January-March â†’ Winter`).
  - Missing values in the `date_added` column were imputed using the most frequent values in the dataset.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **General Statistics**:
  - The dataset spans titles from 1925 to 2021.
  - Movies and TV shows are nearly evenly distributed.
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Bar Chart**: The number of titles added by release type (movies and TV shows).
  - **Pie Chart**: Distribution of titles across different countries.
  - **Trend Analysis**: Year-wise addition of titles shows a steady increase, with a sharp rise after 2015.
  - **Top Genres and Directors**: The most frequent genres and directors contributing to the Netflix library.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **Model**: A Random Forest classifier was trained to predict the optimal release season for a Netflix title.
- **Features**:
  - Type (Movie/TV Show)
  - Genres (e.g., Action, Comedy)
  - Release Year
- **Performance**:
  - Achieved **95.94% accuracy** on the testing data.
  - The model is capable of predicting seasons like Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall based on title attributes.

### 4. Insights and Trends
- **Seasonal Distribution**:
  - A large proportion of titles are added in Fall and Summer.
  - Winter sees the least number of new releases, possibly due to reduced audience engagement.
- **Top Genres and Countries**:
  - Popular genres include Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries.
  - The U.S., India, and the U.K. dominate in terms of content production.

## Project Highlights

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Addressed missing values and created new features like `season` for analysis.
   - Ensured the dataset was suitable for predictive modeling.

2. **Exploratory Insights**:
   - Visualized key trends in Netflix content addition over time.
   - Identified seasonal patterns and genre distributions.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Developed a robust Random Forest model to predict the optimal release season for new titles.
   - The model achieved an exceptionally high accuracy of **96.94%**.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - The project is integrated into a **Streamlit app**, providing an interactive interface for filtering titles and visualizing insights.



## Technical Summary

### Data Sources
