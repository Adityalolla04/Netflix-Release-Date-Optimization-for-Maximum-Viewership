#Netflix Release Date Optimization

## Project Description
The Netflix Release Date Optimization project is an interactive web application designed to analyze and optimize Netflix title release dates for maximum viewership. This application uses data-driven insights from Netflix titles, focusing on seasonal trends and patterns in content addition.

##Key Functionalities
- **Filtering Titles**: Allows filtering of Netflix titles by name, type, and seasonal trends.
- **Seasonal Insights**: Provides visual insights into the distribution of Netflix content across different seasons.
- **Decision Support**: Enables data-driven decision-making for release scheduling based on historical patterns.

##Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow to achieve its objectives:

###1. Dataset Analysis and Cleaning
- **Dataset**: `netflix_titles.csv`.
- **Issues Addressed**:
  - Resolved missing values in the `date_added` column.
  - Created a new `season` feature to categorize titles based on release months.

###2. Modeling and Predictions (Optional)
- Utilized a **Random Forest model (`rf_model.pkl`)** to explore predictive tasks, such as identifying the best release season for specific content types.

###3. App Development
- Built using **Streamlit** to allow users to filter and visualize Netflix title data.
- **Interactive Components**:
  - Sidebar filters.
  - Data tables.
  - Bar charts for seasonal insights.


##Deployment Options
1. **Local Deployment**:
   - Run locally using Python and Streamlit.
   - Use the command: `streamlit run app.py`.

2. **Containerized Deployment**:
   - Containerized the application with **Docker** for easy portability.
   - Build the Docker image: `docker build -t netflix-optimization .`.
   - Run the container: `docker run -p 8501:8501 netflix-optimization`.


##Project Outcomes
This project demonstrates the ability to:
1. **Data Engineering**:
   - Clean and preprocess datasets.
   - Perform feature extraction (e.g., seasonal trends).
2. **Visualization**:
   - Present complex insights in an intuitive, interactive format.
3. **Application Development**:
   - Build an accessible tool using Streamlit.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy applications locally or via containerization (Docker).

##Technical Highlights
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Application Development**: Streamlit.
- **Deployment**: Docker.
