Project Title
Netflix Release Date Optimization

Description
The Netflix Release Date Optimization project is an interactive web application designed to analyze and optimize Netflix title release dates for maximum viewership. The app uses data-driven insights from a dataset of Netflix titles, focusing on seasonal trends and patterns in content addition.

Key functionalities include:

Filtering Netflix titles by name, type, and seasonal trends.
Providing visual insights into the distribution of Netflix content across different seasons.
Allowing users to make data-driven decisions for release scheduling based on historical patterns.
The project showcases the ability to process large datasets, create feature engineering (e.g., identifying seasons based on release dates), and present the results in an accessible and interactive format through Streamlit.
