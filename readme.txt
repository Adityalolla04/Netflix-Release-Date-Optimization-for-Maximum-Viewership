# Netflix Release Date Optimization

## Project Description
The Netflix Release Date Optimization project is an interactive web application designed to analyze and optimize Netflix title release dates for maximum viewership. This application leverages data-driven insights from Netflix titles, focusing on identifying seasonal trends and patterns in content addition, making it a powerful tool for decision-makers in the media industry.

---

## Key Functionalities
- **Filtering Titles**: The app allows users to filter Netflix titles by name, type, and seasonal trends, offering a customized view of the dataset.
- **Seasonal Insights**: It provides visual insights into the distribution of Netflix content across seasons, uncovering key trends in title additions.
- **Decision Support**: By analyzing historical patterns, users can make data-driven decisions for scheduling Netflix title releases to maximize audience engagement.

## Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow to deliver comprehensive insights and functionality:

### 1. Dataset Analysis and Cleaning
- **Dataset**: The project uses the `netflix_titles.csv` dataset, a rich repository of information on Netflix's offerings.
- **Issues Addressed**:
  - Missing values in the `date_added` column were resolved to ensure accurate analysis.
  - A new `season` feature was created by mapping release months to corresponding seasons, enabling seasonal trend analysis.

### 2. Modeling and Predictions
- The project incorporates a **Random Forest model (`rf_model.pkl`)**, trained to predict the optimal release season for specific content types, offering valuable predictive capabilities.

### 3. App Development
- The application is built with **Streamlit**, offering a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Netflix dataset.
- **Interactive Components**:
  - A sidebar allows users to filter titles by specific parameters.
  - Data tables display filtered results for detailed examination.
  - Bar charts provide a visual representation of seasonal trends, simplifying complex data.

## Deployment Options
1. **Local Deployment**:
   - Users can run the app locally using Python and Streamlit.
   - Execute the command: `streamlit run app.py`.

2. **Containerized Deployment**:
   - The application is containerized using **Docker** for cross-platform portability.
   - Build the Docker image: `docker build -t netflix-optimization .`.
   - Run the container: `docker run -p 8501:8501 netflix-optimization`.

## Project Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
1. **Data Engineering**:
   - Effective data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and enhance analysis.
   - Creation of custom features, such as seasonal categorization, to derive actionable insights.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Clear and intuitive visualizations, including bar charts and tables, to highlight trends and patterns.
3. **Application Development**:
   - Development of a dynamic, user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Local and Docker-based deployment options to ensure ease of use and scalability.
